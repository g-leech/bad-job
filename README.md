# ba-job: Bayesian Bad Job Simulator

### A "discrete choice" model of labour turnover and matching


The labour market is a two-sided market for lemons: there are many crap jobs, many crap candidates, and highly expensive and inaccurate measurement of quality on each side.


#### Questions this simulation answers, given heroic assumptions:

* 	What fraction of vacancies are bad?
* 	How many bad workers will an average organisation hire? 
*	How many bad jobs does an average worker take?

Bayesian approach: with an imperfect test (HR, Glassdoor) and huge sampling, how many false positives?


###   Limitations, to be relaxed later:
* 	Binary measure of quality: a job is good or job is bad, likewise candidates.
* 	Otherwise undifferentiated jobs and candidates. Equal pay, status. No licensing.
* 	Point estimate of turnover time
*	De novo market: all jobs start unfilled
*	Static size: No job destruction or creation.
*	Accuracy of firms' vetting process is uniform and 0
*	Accuracy of candidates' vetting process is uniform and 0.
*	Disjoint quit/rehired period
*	Good workers stay in good jobs.
* 	No experience variable
*	No referral
